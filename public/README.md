# PUBLIC

The files in this directory are [publicly accessible via `<href>/<file-path>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/cdn-support-with-asset-prefix).  For example, `http://localhost/logos/logo.svg`.  This is especially convenient for assets used in CSS backgrounds or `<img>` tags, but there are more applications too.  For example, [global stylesheets](./style/README.md).

There are no rules in particular for this folder structure, except to use practical judgment and not let things get too unorganized.
