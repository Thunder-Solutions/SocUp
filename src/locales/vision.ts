    industriesDesc: 'Most industries and nearly every brand has a future with SocUp. As a for-profit charity concept, SocUp doesn\'t compete to exist but rather offers tax breaks through NFT collectible purchasing, human development, industry specific repairs, idea funnels, and employee benefits.',
    prosperityTitle: 'Global Prosperity',
    prosperityDesc: 'One long term goal of SocUp is to generate solutions for poverty and debt. While SocUp doesn\'t expect everyone to make the same money, the vision is that poorest people can still afford basic amenities, yearly vacations, leisure, time with people they care for, etc.',
    spaceTitle: 'Space Race',
    spaceDesc: 'Humans are going to space and SocUp wants to speed up the process. By creating a new economic model where money grows in line with significant infrastructure upgrades, money and value will increase exponentially over time. Money at the end of the day is a social construct and SocUp redefines by creating alternatives to the current game of monopoly everyone currently plays. After 7-10 years, SocUp expects to be ready for a full Mars Mission rather than just a probe team.',
